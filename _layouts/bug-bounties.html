        Particl is a security and privacy oriented project looking into restoring the balance of privacy back to the users and keeping them safe from exploits. As such, this permanent bug bounty is put in place in order to encourage the responsible disclosure of any bug or vulnerability contained within the Particl code and reward those who find them.
